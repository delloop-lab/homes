# Direct Link to Supabase URL Configuration

## Direct Link

Try this direct link to your project's URL configuration:

**Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` with: `ivcsxedmkuyutfvudyfl`**

```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ivcsxedmkuyutfvudyfl/auth/url-configuration
```

Or try:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ivcsxedmkuyutfvudyfl/settings/auth
```

## If the Link Doesn't Work

The URL configuration might be in a different location. Try these:

1. **Authentication → Settings**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ivcsxedmkuyutfvudyfl/auth
   - Look for a "Settings" or "Configuration" button/tab

2. **Project Settings → Auth**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ivcsxedmkuyutfvudyfl/settings/auth
   - Look for "URL Configuration" or "Redirect URLs"

3. **API Settings**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ivcsxedmkuyutfvudyfl/settings/api
   - Sometimes redirect URLs are here

## Alternative: Use Supabase Management API

If you can't find it in the UI, we can set it via API. Let me know if you want me to create a script for that.
